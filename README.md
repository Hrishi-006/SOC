# SOC

I have been following the resources timeline that the mentor had sent, first learning the basics of numpy, matplotlib and pandas.
I completed Andrew Ng's first 2 courses on Machine Learning and have uploaded the proof of completion in which I learned about the mathematics behind neural networks and machine learning models, binary trees, linear and logistic regression.

I am currently watching Andrej Karpathy's playlist on neural networks.
